I am 100% committed to helping every student achieve their best in this class; education is a partnership between student and teacher with each taking responsibility to do their part. Your #1 part is to do the assignments (reading, homeworks, exercises, project) early and correctly, asking questions and for help if you do not understand something.
My part is to select and present material in a way that you should be able to understand (given the prerequisites), to assign homeworks and exercises to allow you to exercise your knowledge of the material, guide you through challenges, provide you feedback on your mastery of the material, and evaluate you.
